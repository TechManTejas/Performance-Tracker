Hereâ€™s how you can integrate it into your project:

1. **Import the Widget**:

```javascript
import PerformanceTracker from 'performance-tracker-widget';
```

2. **Initialize the Tracker**:

```javascript
PerformanceTracker.init({
  container: '#performance-container', // The DOM element where the widget will be rendered
  chartType: 'line',                    // The type of chart (e.g., 'line', 'bar')
});
```

Make sure to include a `div` with the ID `performance-container` in your HTML.
